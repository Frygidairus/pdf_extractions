A Suggestion Box Entry from Bob Carter
Dear Anonymous,
I’m not quite sure I understand the concept of this‘Anonymous’ Suggestion
Box. If no one reads what we write, then how will anything ever change?
But in the spirit of good will, I’ve decided to oﬀer my two cents, and hopefully
Kevin won’t steal it!(ha, ha). I would really like to see more varieties of coﬀee
in the coﬀee machine in the break room. /quotesingle.ts1Milk and sugar/quotesingle.ts1, /quotesingle.ts1black with
sugar/quotesingle.ts1, /quotesingle.ts1extra sugar/quotesingle.ts1and /quotesingle.ts1cream and sugar/quotesingle.ts1don’t oﬀer much diversity.
Also, the selection of drinks seems heavily weighted in favor of/quotesingle.ts1sugar/quotesingle.ts1. What
if we don’t want any sugar?
But all this is beside the point because I quite like sugar, to be honest. In fact,
that’s my second suggestion: more sugar in the oﬃce. Cakes, candy, insulin,
aspartame... I’m not picky. I’ll take it by mouth or inject it intravenously, if I
have to.
Also, if someone could please ﬁx the lock on the men’s room stall, that would
be helpful. Yesterday I was doing my business when Icarus nearly climbed into
my lap.
