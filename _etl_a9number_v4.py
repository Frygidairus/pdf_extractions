    Count the number of occurrences of a specific word in a given text, case-insensitively.

    The function ensures that only whole word matches are counted, avoiding partial matches
    within other words. It uses regular expressions to identify word boundaries while 
    allowing for punctuation and special characters around the word.

    Args:
        word (str): The word to count occurrences of.
        text (str): The text in which to search for the word.

    Returns:
        int: The number of times the word appears in the text as a standalone word.
