A Suggestion Box Entry from Bob Carter
Dear Anonymous,
I’mnotquitesureIunderstandtheconceptofthis‘Anonymous’ Suggestion
Box. If no one reads what we write, then how will anything ever change?
But in the spirit of good will, I’ve decided to offer my two cents, and hopefully
Kevin won’t steal it! (ha, ha). I would really like to see more varieties of coffee
in the coffee machine in the break room. 'Milk and sugar', 'black with
sugar', 'extra sugar' and 'cream and sugar' don’t offer much diversity.
Also, the selection of drinks seems heavily weighted in favor of 'sugar'. What
if we don’t want any sugar?
But all this is beside the point because I quite like sugar, to be honest. In fact,
that’s my second suggestion: more sugar in the office. Cakes, candy, insulin,
aspartame... I’m not picky. I’ll take it by mouth or inject it intravenously, if I
have to.
Also, if someone could please fix the lock on the men’s room stall, that would
be helpful. Yesterday I was doing my business when Icarus nearly climbed into
my lap.
